    <string name="turing_name">Alan Turing</string>
    <string name="turing_description">Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. That paper also introduced the &quot;Turing machine. His papers on the subject are widely acknowledged as the foundation of research in artificial intelligence.</string>
